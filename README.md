# Bigfoot-Sightings-Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard analyzing Bigfoot sightings across the United States. This project visualizes key metrics like total sightings, sightings by state and year, and the correlation between sightings and full moon phases. Explore the data through interactive visuals and uncover trends in Bigfoot activity!

# Bigfoot Sightings Dashboard - Power BI Project

## Project Overview
This project explores data on Bigfoot sightings across the United States and creates a comprehensive dashboard to visualize key trends and insights. The dashboard was built using Power BI, showcasing various metrics such as sighting counts by state, year, and full moon occurrences.

## Key Features
- **Total Sightings Overview**: Displays the overall count of Bigfoot sightings from the dataset.
- **% Full Moon Sightings**: A calculated measure that indicates the percentage of sightings that occurred during a full moon.
- **Sightings by State**: A visual breakdown of which states report the highest number of sightings.
- **Sightings by Year**: A trendline showing how the number of sightings has evolved over time.
- **Interactive Map**: A geographic view to explore sightings at different levels (state, county, etc.).
- **Sighting Frequency During Lunar Phases**: Visualizations that analyze sightings based on lunar phases to determine correlations with full moon nights.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI**: Used for data visualization, modeling, and report creation.
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning and transformation.
- **DAX**: Measures were written in DAX, including '% Full Moon Sightings' and 'Total Sightings'.

## Insights
- States with dense forest cover, such as Washington and California, tend to report the highest number of sightings.
- There is a slight correlation between Bigfoot sightings and full moon phases, although more data is required to establish a firm conclusion.
- Sightings have seen an increase during certain decades, possibly due to a rise in public interest or media influence.

## Usage
To explore the dashboard:
1. Download the `.pbix` file from this repository.
2. Open the file using Power BI Desktop.
3. Use the interactive visuals to filter and explore various aspects of the data.

## Future Improvements
- Adding a detailed time analysis to determine the most common times of year or day for sightings.
- Incorporating additional datasets, such as weather patterns, to better understand environmental factors influencing sightings.
- Adding more advanced DAX measures for further insights.
